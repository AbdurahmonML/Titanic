# Titanic
The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used in machine learning and data analysis. It contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including their demographics (such as age, gender, and class), ticket information, and survival status. Our goal is to train models capable of predicting passenger survival based on their information.
